title: Changing Jekyll What?

What is Jekyll? This is going to be easy right? Is this the same as Wordpress?
Starting out I had no idea what I was doing in Jekyll and could barely get it the simplest of css changes to work. This was far more confusing than I thought it was going to be. Before starting the challenging task of styling my blog, I thought, “I got this, it’s going to be so easy”.  

I was wrong. It was not easy. It took me twice as long as I thought it would to do the simplest of changes. This includes changing the font, colors of links and basic spacing layout. However, I did get a slider plugin working which made me want to do a little happy dance. It still needs some work, but for right now it’s doing it’s job.

I still need to finesse styling, but it’s a work in progress.
